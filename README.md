Time Series Analysis of Login Data

This is a time series analysis of about 100,000 login timestamps over the course of eight months in one location. The goal of this exploratory data analysis was to visualize and describe the time series counts to characterize the patterns of usage and demand.

The analysis consists of:
1) exploratory summary stats
2) Fourier Analysis to identify the major cycles
3) stl (Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess) analysis:
• Daily
• Weekly
• Monthly

The analysis was originally done late 2016. It is briefly updated to post it here.
